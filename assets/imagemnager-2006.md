# ImageManager 2.0 (2006)

>Way back in 2006, I released ImageManager 2.0, a popular WordPress plugin for image management and editing. Below is the original documentation for that plugin.

The ImageManager plugin integrates the stand alone PHP ImageManager + Editor with WordPress. The ImageManager provides an interface for browsing and uploading image files on/to your server. The Editor allows for some basic image manipulations such as, cropping, rotation, flip, and scaling.
